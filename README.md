## About

This project provides a basic examples mulbtiple Sort algorithm implemented in R. It's meant for educational purposes and to demonstrate how the algorithm works.

bubble sort = pairs of adjacent elements are compared, and the elements swapped if they are not in order
- Quadratic time O(n^2)
- Smaller datasets not a big problem
- the bigger the dataset the slower this algorithm becomes



## Usage

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that can be used to sort arrays of data in ascending or descending order. You can use the provided implementation as a reference or a starting point for your own sorting needs.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have:

R version:  R-4.3.1
Rstudio:  RStudio-2023.09.1-494

For auto setting up a working directory you will need the following package: rstudioapi


### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bunkerbuster/SortingInR.git
```

### Example
Here's an example of how to use the Bubble Sort algorithm in C#:

int[] arr = { 64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90 };

// Sort the array using Bubble Sort
